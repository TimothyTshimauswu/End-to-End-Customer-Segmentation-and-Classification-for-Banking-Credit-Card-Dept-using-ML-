</div>
A full-stack behavioural analytics system I built to segment banking customers by spending patterns, income levels, and financial behaviour. The goal is to support targeted product design, improve marketing accuracy, and increase engagement and conversion.

## Executive Summary

This project started with my own experience as a South African banking customer. Standard Bank and Capitec frequently contacted me with product offers. Some matched my spending habits and income band. Others felt unrelated to my lifestyle. I wanted to understand how banks decide who receives credit cards, lifestyle bundles, investment products, or rewards programmes, and why some offers align while others do not.

I built a segmentation engine using engineered behavioural features, PCA, K-Means, and a Decision Tree to group customers into meaningful clusters. These clusters help banks target products more accurately, increase engagement, and reduce wasted marketing spend. I deployed a Streamlit interface so marketing, product, and BI teams can explore segments and identify high-value groups.

## Business Problem

Banks face four common challenges.

1. Low engagement from poorly targeted product offers.  
2. Marketing spend wasted on customers unlikely to convert.  
3. Limited insight into behaviour-driven product fit.  
4. Difficulty identifying cross-sell and up-sell opportunities.

This project answers:

- How customers differ in spending, income, and repayment behaviour.  
- Which behaviour patterns predict high or low engagement?  
- How segmentation improves targeting and campaign efficiency.  
- Which groups align with wealth, credit, lifestyle, or savings products?


## Key Objectives

- Preprocess and scale customer behavioural data  
- Build PCA components for more interpretable features  
- Apply K-Means to generate meaningful customer segments  
- Train a Decision Tree classifier to predict segment labels  
- Deploy a Streamlit app for real-time scoring  
- Provide actionable insights for financial product teams

## Technical Overview

### 1. Data Engineering

I engineered features such as:

- Income bands  
- Spending categories  
- Transaction frequency  
- Credit utilisation  
- Repayment behaviour  
- Lifestyle and activity indicators  

### 2. Feature Reduction and Clustering

I used PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-Means to create stable, interpretable segments.

The clusters show:

- Clear separation across behaviour groups  
- Low intra-cluster variance  
- High inter-cluster separation

### 3. Segment Interpretation

I trained a Decision Tree to create simple rules that explain each segment. This helps business teams understand why customers fall into specific groups.
**Supervised Learning – Decision Tree Classifier**  
- Target: Cluster label assigned by K-Means  
- Train-test split: 70/30  
- Accuracy: ~92%  
- Metrics: Classification Report + Confusion Matrix  

### 4. Insights and Marketing Analytics

I built analytics summarising:

- Engagement potential  
- Spending and lifestyle patterns  
- Income and credit behaviour  
- Ideal product alignment per segment  

### 5. Deployment

I deployed a Streamlit interface that allows teams to explore segments, review customer behaviour summaries, and download insight reports.
- Models serialized with `joblib` and `pickle.`  
- Streamlit app runs locally or through Streamlit Cloud  
- PCA, scaler, and clustering pipelines integrated end-to-end  
- CSV batch scoring supported for business workflows  

Streamlit App Overview
The Streamlit application enables:

- **Single-customer scoring**  
- **CSV upload for batch scoring**  
- **Real-time behavioural classification**  
- **Prediction outputs for business users**

## Results and Business Impact

This system improves marketing accuracy and operational efficiency.

1. Behaviour-aligned segmentation increases product relevance.  
2. Targeted campaigns deliver higher engagement.  
3. Marketing waste is reduced.  
4. Campaign planning becomes faster.  
5. Product and retention strategies improve through behavioural insight.

## How Teams Use This System

- Marketing teams use segments for targeted campaigns.  
- Product teams match offerings to the most relevant groups.  
- BI teams explore behaviour patterns across the customer base.  
- Management reviews segment-level revenue and engagement potential.

## Recommendations

1. Integrate segmentation into the CRM platform.  
2. Build personalised marketing journeys based on segment rules.  
3. Expand features using credit-bureau and richer transactional data.  
4. Add uplift modelling for predicted campaign response.

## Next Steps

1. Automate retraining using fresh behavioural data.  
2. Add drift monitoring for stability.  
3. Support multi-product segmentation.  
4. Deploy the engine on AWS for scale.
