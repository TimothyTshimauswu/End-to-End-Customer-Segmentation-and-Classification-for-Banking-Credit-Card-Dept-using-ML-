## Project Background

With the rise of AI and targeted marketing, banks are prioritising behaviour-driven analytics to improve product performance, strengthen customer engagement, and optimise credit decisions. Understanding how customers spend, repay, and use their credit facilities is essential for designing relevant savings products, personal loans, and wealth management offers. Retail banks such as FNB and ABSA, as well as major credit lenders, rely on this intelligence to run high-performing product and marketing campaigns. Industry research shows that behaviour-based segmentation can increase campaign conversion by **20–30%** and reduce early-stage delinquency by **10–15%**, making it a key driver of business value.

### Objective  
To build a machine learning–driven customer segmentation engine and classification model that groups customers by behavioural patterns and scores new customers in real time.

### Business Value  
This solution enables:  
- More accurate **targeted marketing** and personalised product recommendations  
- Improved **portfolio profitability** through better customer insights  
- Stronger **credit-risk monitoring** using behavioural indicators  
- Faster, scalable **decision support** through automated segmentation and a Streamlit app  

This directly supports analytics, CRM, credit risk, and product teams across retail banking and lending. ```

## Dataset Structure and Description

The dataset contains behavioural and transactional features for over 8,000 credit-card customers. It includes information on spending patterns, repayment behaviour, credit utilisation, and account activity. Key variables include:

- **Balance and credit limit**  
- **One-off and installment purchases**  
- **Cash advances and transaction counts**  
- **Payment amounts and minimum payments**  
- **Full payment behaviour and tenure**

These features represent the core behavioural signals used by banks to understand customer usage, assess credit needs, and segment their retail portfolios.
